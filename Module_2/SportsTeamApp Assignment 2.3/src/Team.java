/**
 * (The Team class). Design a class named Team to represent a sports team. The class contains:
 * 1. A private string data field named teamName that specifies the teams name. The default is an empty string.
 * 2. A private string array data field named players that specifies the players assigned to a team. The default size is 20.
 * 3. A private int data field named playerCount that specifies the number of players on a team.The default is 0.
 * 4. An argument constructor that creates a team using the teamName data field as an argument.
 * 5. A public method named addPlayer with a string argument that adds a player to the players data field. This method should increment the playerCount data field, so you are able to use the arrayâ€™s index to add new players.
 * 6. A public string array method named getPlayers that returns the players data field.
 * 7. A public int method named getPlayerCount that returns the playerCount data field.
 * 8. A public string method named getTeamName that returns the teamName data field.
